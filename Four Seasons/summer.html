	Summer is probably the most popular time of year even though people spend half the time complaining about how hot it is. As in as kids the beginning of Summer also marks the end of school and people spending time with their friends in the nice weather. People think of Summer as lasting from June til the beginning of September.  Summer is the time of year where kids like Charlie Brown go out and do things with his friends like play baseball or go to the beach. Baseball season really gets into full gear this time of year while basketball is FINALLY coming to a close for the season. The holiday most associated with this season in the U.S.A is the fourth of July where people come together to celebrate the greatest country in the world 'MERICA!</p>
