	Winter is the time of year where people come together (mostly to complain about how cold it is). People like to think of Winter to go from December until beginning of March (even though in Montana it seems to last a lot longer). This is the time of year where basketball really gets started up and football comes to a close. It's also when Charlie Brown and his friends go out sledding and ice skating as well as singing Christmas Carolls. Holidays most closely associated with this season includes New Year's, Valentines day, and of Course CHRISTMAS. </p>
