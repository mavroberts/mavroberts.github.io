	<p>	For my first website review, I review ESPN’s website. Here is the link to the <a href= "https://www.espn.com/" target= "_new">website </a>. At first glance this seems like a very solid website. Its colors are pleasing to the eye with it two primary colors (red and black) matching the ESPN’s company’s colors while having yellow where the stories and other links could be accessed with ESPN+ subscription. It has a good format with links to anything you could possibly want. The left side of the menu bar has sports leagues links you can click on to get to whatever team and whatever news you want to get to, while the right side of the menu bar takes you to ways to watch or listen to teams to play, as well as to all the fantasy news you need to get. The website is set up with three columns; the left leads you to some quick links, other ESPN sites and ESPN social media, while the middle column (which is the biggest) gives you the current top stories from ESPN, and finally the right column gives you other stories you might be interested in as well as links to some podcasts. I like this layout but I feel like it would be better if there was more margin in between the columns because it feels a little crowded with it all being in the middle with white space on the ends. 
	After viewing the source code, it is obvious that this website is modern and kept well up to date with all the links and thousands of lines of code in it. I saw in the top there was some meta code that has the website adapt to whatever screen you view it on. I like how it adapts to your phone with putting the most important column (middle)to the center while sprinkling in the links and stories from the right column in while you scroll down.  It also does a good job of replacing the navigation menu links into the “burger button” that you can press and easily access the same links. Overall this is a very good and modern website with only a small spacing issue in my opinion. </p> 
	
	<p>The second website I reviewed was my old high school’s website <a href= "https://billingscatholicschools.org/" target= "_new">billingscatholicschools.org </a>. You can tell from first glance that this website is certainly less complex than the ESPN website (as it should be) with only 300 some lines of code compared to ESPN’s two thousand lines of code. Its color scheme looks appealing to the eye matching the school’s primary colors (green and white). Its navigation has all the links you could possibly need with three separate sections of links. A small thing I did notice that kind of bothers me is there are no titles when you hover over the tabs. This could be confusing for the section of links that are only pictures, as a former student I understand what those mean but someone new to the school or unfamiliar with the logos may have trouble understanding what they are. The website is adaptable to smaller screens but the homepage does a poor job for phone screens. It’s hard to read the green header text with the picture in the background and a word is partially covered with the Billings Catholic Schools logo. The navigation looks bad with the picture link being off with the menu bar and the other link in the top bar remain small while one of the links goes down in its own row. Other than that initial home page it looks good when you scroll down and click the links. So overall this is a pretty good and simple website where they just miss the mark on a couple of things.</p>
	
	
	<p>The final website I reviewed was by far the worst one. It is the Yale School of Arts website <a href= "https://www.art.yale.edu/" target= "_new"> (art.yale.edu) </a>. To be fair I found this website by googling “ten worst websites” and got a list of the 50 worst and picked the top one. It hurts my eyes to look at this because the background is several tiles of a gif of a dog on a turtle. To be fair it does give you the option of pausing the animation. What makes it so hard to look at is the use of so many hard to look at colors, fonts, and animations that have almost no rhyme or reason. Everything on this page is to the left which is kind of annoying, it looks better when you have It on a phone screen because everything is then centered. After viewing the source code, it appears the images were not done by percentages so that’s why it doesn’t fit the laptop screen the way it should but instead fits better with the phone screen. Overall this website is probably the most painful one to view.</p>
