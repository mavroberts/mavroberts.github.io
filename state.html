<h1> My State Website Review </h1>

<h2>1. <a href= "https://nebraska.gov" target= "_new" title= "view Nebraska State website"> Nebraska</a> </h2>
<p>After reviewing all of these websites I have determined that this is the best one out of the five in my opinion. It has a nice looking design without being too flashy with all of the pictures of the state. These search bar and easy to use whether your on your computer or phone. It adapts well making it obvious where you click to find the links in the search bar. This is why in my opinion this is the best State website. </p>

<h2>2. <a href= "https://mt.gov/" target= "_new" title= "view Montana State website"> Montana</a> </h2>
<p>After looking through the Montana state website a few times I've determined that it is a pretty solid website. It looks nice with the nature backgrounds. It has a good layout with the news right up front with the Governor and other top features for the website. It's adaptable to smaller screens so that is a big plus to smartphone users. I'd say my only real problem with it is the menu bar just from how it is set up and the imense number of links you have to serch through to find what your looking for. Otherwise I think this is a very good State website with only some small problems.</p>

<h2>3. <a href= "https://az.gov/" target= "_new" title= "view Arizona State website"> Arizona</a></h2>
<p>The state of Arizona has an all right State website. It's adaptable which is a positive, but I don't like how they adapt with having the serch menu being a small little bar. I think it looks good with the pictures and the background but I find all the pictures and needing to click through them is unnecessary and annoying. Overall this is a pretty good state website but not close to being my favorite. </p>


<h2>4. <a href= "https://www.nh.gov/index.htm" target= "_new" title= "view New Hampshire State website"> New Hampshire</a> </h2>
<p> The New Hampshire website is a nice, clean and simple website. It's menu bar is easy to navigate and has large links which is good for smartphone users. Problems this website has though is that it kind of looks a little boring with the white background with only a background picture for the header of the website. It is an adaptable website to an extent, it can handle a smaller IPad screen but does't fully wrap for a smartphone user. This website was really not all that special, but it was alright.</p>

<h2>5.<a href= "https://alaska.gov/" target= "_new" title="view Alaska State website">  Alaska</a> </h2>
<p>After reviewing this website I have determined that this one is my least favorite website out of the five. I don't like the layout of this website, it is condensed with small links which would make it hard for people with phones to click on the right links. I don't like how the background is just blue in the background, it makes the website look boring and shows they put not as much effort into this website than they could have. The wirst part of this State website is that it is not adaptable for smaller screens which leads to people on their phones having to scroll up, down, left and right to get to where they need to go which can be frustrating and annoying. This is why I think this is the worst State website out of the five. </p>
